# Sales Marketing Predictions

This project involves predicting sales figures based on TV advertising expenditure using a simple linear regression model in Python.

## Overview

Sales prediction is crucial for businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and maximize revenue. In this project, we use TV advertising expenditure as a predictor variable to forecast sales figures. We train a linear regression model on historical data and use it to make predictions for new advertising expenditures.
